# v3 Roadmap

This version introduces:
- HYDRA persona field over RSVP lattice nodes.
- Xylomorphic city/organ generator.
- Semantic merge operator animation.
- Delta–sigma modulators attached to CLIO graph edges.
- Cinematic camera orbit / helper v3.
- Batch run + render scripts.

Future v3.x ideas:
- GPU-based PDE solvers using geometry nodes and simulation nodes.
- Sheaf-theoretic overlays on xylomorphic city structures.
- Explicit MAGI geodesic solvers coupled to HYDRA persona flows.
- Semantic logging (JSON manifests of each simulation run).
