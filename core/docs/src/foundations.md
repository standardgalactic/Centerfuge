# Foundations

## Abstract
A unified infrastructure for linguistics, physics, and interactive systems is presented. The core employs type-safe Rust crates with separated Python bindings for exploratory workflows.

## Background
We draw on recent practice in scientific computing to formulate a reproducible, testable stack for RSVP/TARTAN/Flyxion et al.

## Notation
- Φ: scalar capacity
- **v**: vector flow
- S: entropy field
