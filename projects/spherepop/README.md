# spherepop

Bubble-based programming demo. Each line is an instruction:
- `PUSH <name> <value>`  push a bubble with name and value
- `MERGE`                merge top two bubbles (sum values, concat names)
- `SPLIT <ratio>`        split top bubble by ratio (e.g., 0.3)
- `PRINT`                print the current stack
